# rl_for_oal - Reinforcement Learning for Opportunistic Active Learning

Project Goals -
- Can we learn a policy for opportunistic active learning - that is trading off queries that would help in future interactions, with finishing the current interaction quickly
- Can we learn how to choose between predicates in a multilabel setting?
