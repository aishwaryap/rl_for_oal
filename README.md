# rl_for_oal - Reinforcement Learning for Opportunistic Active Learning

Project Goals -
- Can we learn a policy for opportunistic active learning - that is trading off queries that would help in future interactions, with finishing the current interaction quickly
- Can we learn how to choose between predicates in a multilabel setting?

# Dependencies

Download and preprocess the Visual Genome dataset using - https://github.com/aishwaryap/dataset_preprocessing
Instructions are present at [dataset_preprocessing/VisualGenome/README.md](https://github.com/aishwaryap/dataset_preprocessing/blob/master/VisualGenome/README.md)
