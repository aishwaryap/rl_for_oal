# rl_for_oal - Reinforcement Learning for Opportunistic Active Learning

Project Goals -
- Can we learn a policy for opportunistic active learning - that is trading off queries that would help in future interactions, with finishing the current interaction quickly
- Can we learn how to choose between predicates in a multilabel setting?

# Dependencies

Download and preprocess the Visual Genome dataset using [this commit](https://github.com/aishwaryap/dataset_preprocessing/commit/d51cb6b2c6c61ddc473cca7c89ff44b8b75ea901) of [my preprocessing repository](https://github.com/aishwaryap/dataset_preprocessing)
Instructions are present at [dataset_preprocessing/VisualGenome/README.md](https://github.com/aishwaryap/dataset_preprocessing/blob/master/VisualGenome/README.md)
